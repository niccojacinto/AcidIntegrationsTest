# AcidIntegrationsTest

This test consists of 3 parts. Unity, web and backend.

Part A - Backend
Build a simple Node.js/Express API server that accepts reads and updates a MongoDB database running at localhost. Add a data model that consists of a x, y,  and z for rotation speed, and a r, g and b values for color.

Part B - Web Frontend
Build a simple web interface for reading and modifying the data created in Part A. Nothing fancy, just needs to get the job done. Use a web framework (Vue or React).

Part C - Unity
Create a spinning, color changing cube inside of Unity. Read the values of the data in part A via the API you created to adjust the rotational velocity and color at a 1 second interval.

All components should run on localhost. I should be able to start the Part A server, Part B frontend and Part C Unity app and expect them to all work under these conditions.

Please submit in the form of a public repo on GitHub containing all three parts so that we may clone your repository and evaluate your work.
